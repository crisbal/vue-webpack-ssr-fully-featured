## Thanks

For mostly the build scripts and SSR we are using code from a few different repos:

* [vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-hackernews-2.0)
* [vuejs/pwa](https://github.com/vuejs/pwa/)
* [Narkoleptika/webpack-everything](https://github.com/Narkoleptika/webpack-everything)

The code for the build scripts and SSR was taken and changed for our needs.
